        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <h3>Exit Criteria</h3>
        <p>For the system to move to the next phase of development, the exit criteria, which defines the test plan's minimum completion, must be met. The following criteria have been identified as exit criteria for the ETL  Utility Test Plan:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All tests outlined per phase in this plan have been completed</li>
          <li>The minimum code coverage requirement has been met</li>
          <li>No critical or high severity defects are outstanding</li>
          <li>Less than 5 total defects per phase exist</li>
          </ul>
        <h3>Summary & Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Testing is an important phase for the development life cycle. While this plan is not all-encompassing, the system's main attributes that are the most critical to the user have been identified through the requirements and design process and are outlined in this document as test areas to be considered. By breaking testing down into several phases that focus on specific modules of the system, the required dependencies are prioritized to be tested first to ensure no delay in resolving defects or the testing process as a whole. This test plan may continue to expand and become more refined as the system evolves, and new requirements are identified. This test plan aims to provide the foundation for a successful testing strategy that addresses the system's requirements and design and provides flexibility as needed to incorporate additional testing scripts that are required along the way to ensure the highest quality software system.</p>
